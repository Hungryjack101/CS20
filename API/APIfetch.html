        &emsp;The API I chose is called Agify.io, an API that takes a name and gives
        a predicted age for that name. It can be found at https://api.agify.io/?name=jack,
        but of course you change the value for name at the end of the link to try
        out different names. The option I used for the API request was the name
        value. In this website, for instance, you can input a name and my website
        alters the name option in the link to display the predicted age value
        taken from the website/the JSON values returned.<br>
        &emsp;This API would be useful for fun, having someone you know try it
        and seeing how close it is to their age. It can be (and has been) useful for
        important statistics. For example, it was used alongside other APIs for
        a report on The Guardian, analyzing 70 million comments posted on their
        website. It provided quantitative evidence for online abuse and trolling,
        indicating that the targets of the most online abuse were females and minorities.
